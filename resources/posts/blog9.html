                    <span class="foot-text2">The optimal way of learning new things isn't surreal.<br>Post #9<br>Nagpur, December 02 2019, 22:57 IST </span><br>

                    <p>Remember the good old days? When we were kids and alphabets were not used in math. Learning those alphabets was altogether a different adventure for all of us. How did we learn them? First we tried to remember what A looks like and what it is called. Then came innocent B, then C and so on. Time passed and we were singing the alphabet song, yes we used a rhythm to keep these things in mind. Then finally, good days were over, and here we were speaking relatively complicated sentences, learning grammar and not once consciously trying to remember what comes after P or Y or G. And here we surrendered the most and the only intuitive learning technique which should come to us naturally but our overthinking and overplanning killed it.<br><br>We, today, are faced with many situations where life demands learning new things. Stressed out, as we are, we often end up not learning the right way. So when in delusion, reminding ourselves of our tiny days can save us from getting into unexpected anxiety. There are three stages of learning:<br>1. First when we try to learn (remember) the basic units/concepts of the thing at hand just as is while trying to remember everything’s use too.
<br>2. Second when we keep using it, making an ‘alphabet song’. We design ways to remember things and their uses in some way - we make use of irrelevant analogies that stick in our mind and it works a freakishly many number of times.
<br>3. In no time, things become so intuitive that we don't have to consciously remind yourself of those things.
<br><br>Maybe some of us already and obviously follow this but I found it quite relevant to read it out loud and remind myself at the time when I foolishly tried to scramble around websites trying to learn things and doubt myself that I will never be able to remember the great load of data which, eventually, I successfully did.<br><br>

<!-- A word of caution. It's easy to get caught up doing nothing on social media. So it is better that you consciously proceed with this. However, as the world dictates, you need to have a digital social existence. Despite its threat, there are ways you can use this medium for your own benefits (more on that later). Facebook is quite popular to start with.<br>
Besides this, you need to sign up for LinkedIn (more on how to make a good linkedin profile, later).
I will write a detailed post about this topic quite soon.
Let's continue with the primer in the next post.-->
