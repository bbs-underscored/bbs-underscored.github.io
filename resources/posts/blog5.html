            <p>You are going to get stuck for sure at some point of time. Using search engines to find the solution is our obvious choice. And as it turns out, you would get your problems solved by this simple method almost every time.<br>However, don’t accept the solution if you feel even a little uncomfortable. You can try to find answers on<a target="_blank" class="type7" href="https://stackoverflow.com/"> StackOverflow</a> which is the most standard forum you will find on the internet. If your query is not present as an already asked question, go on and ask it yourself. Other standard websites include <a target="_blank" class="type7" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/"> GeeksforGeeks</a>, <a target="_blank" class="type7" href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3schools</a> etc. Sign up on <a target="_blank" class="type7" href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>, it has awesome set of technical articles to get help from and for general reading. If you are not satisfied by this, try this unusual method, which rarely comes to our mind.<br>
        <span class="subheading">Youtube saves the day:</span><br>Most of the time you will find a video about your exact concern already posted on youtube with all the necessary steps performed in the video. Spare yourself from surfing unnecessary content on Youtube and start exploiting its power. You can also follow tech vloggers, reviewers and other similar channels. The greatest benefit I got was about the installation videos. It has installation videos about almost everything. Later when you would start getting into complicated stuff, it is very handy to watch a video of how to install things before you actually jump into doing it.<br>
        Let's continue in the next post.<br>

<!-- A word of caution. It's easy to get caught up doing nothing on social media. So it is better that you consciously proceed with this. However, as the world dictates, you need to have a digital social existence. Despite its threat, there are ways you can use this medium for your own benefits (more on that later). Facebook is quite popular to start with.<br>
        Besides this, you need to sign up for LinkedIn (more on how to make a good linkedin profile, later).
        I will write a detailed post about this topic quite soon.
        Let's continue with the primer in the next post.-->
