                    <p>There are great chances that you would need to handle many files eg. PDFs, lecture slides, e-books etc in your daily life. You need to keep this data flow under control. For doing so, you must manage them properly in good folder structures. Sounds obvious? Sounds trivial and unnecessary? No, it is not. If you are doing it already, its great. However, if you are not doing that, get ready to be frustrated when you start experimenting with new technologies. Organizing digital space would add to your comfort levels and relieve your stress when you have to make system wide changes.<br>
                        <span class="subheading"> Try out online tools and cloud services:</span><br>Learn about the different ways you can share and store files using google drive. Also check out google’s online office softwares like docs, slides, sheets etc. Explore google forms. Utilize the power of cloud services. Keep your documents backed-up. You can also check Microsoft’s online tools. Use CamScanner and online conversion tools like smallPDF. There are many options. Don’t limit yourself to what I say. Choice is yours. Try Grammarly for improving your writing. It’s so damn cool.  Make a point to check out new tools whenever possible. <br>Again, this is not a thing to do in one go. Keep these things in mind as you proceed with other things.<br>

<!-- A word of caution. It's easy to get caught up doing nothing on social media. So it is better that you consciously proceed with this. However, as the world dictates, you need to have a digital social existence. Despite its threat, there are ways you can use this medium for your own benefits (more on that later). Facebook is quite popular to start with.<br>
Besides this, you need to sign up for LinkedIn (more on how to make a good linkedin profile, later).
I will write a detailed post about this topic quite soon.
Let's continue with the primer in the next post.-->
