                    <p>*seasoned coders moaning in the background*<br>This is unnecessary they might yell. But I feel this step is as essential as any advanced knowledge about different frameworks you would acquire in the near future.<br>In early learning, when we surpass a threshold, we need to start learning independently. Most of it happens through thorough searches on the internet and trying out new development environments or methodologies. All these encounters can be very overwhelming and the initial fear of experimenting can be immense, leading to delays. Much of it can be reduced by the following process.<br>Own your digital life. How?<br>
                        <span class="subheading">1. Get your workstation</span><br>It would be great (and must in the future) to have your own workstation, preferably a good laptop.<br>


                        <span class="subheading">2. Know your device</span><br>Get familiar with the user interface. Many people are familiar with their machines but quite superficially. You should know how to manage files, what all the options you’ve got in settings section and anything different you notice. Keep your device updated. This way you would never be afraid of experimenting. It is not that you can complete this in one go. Don’t waste too much time on this. This activity is more or less like a continuous one which would happen over time. If you are an avid computer user, it might turn out that you are already great with your computer. The aim is to make you comfortable with your workspace.<br>
