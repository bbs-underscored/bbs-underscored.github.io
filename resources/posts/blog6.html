                    <p><span class="subheading">Active exploration:</span><br>Make a habit of clicking on ‘options’, ‘more’, ‘drawers’, hamburger buttons and so on. It is through this activity that you would learn new things. Hunt down every single option in any new app you see or a website you stumble upon.<br>
                        <span class="subheading">You are not enough alone:</span><br>
                        Stay updated about what your seniors and peers are up to by interacting with them in day to day life. Ask them what they are currently working on, what resources they are using and how you should study etc. Don't hide what you are up to. Don’t become what you don’t want others to be. Share the same things about you. Share what you are doing and how you are doing it. It can never be a one-man army. Be a team player. Build your circle. Get things running. The more active your circle is, the better you will get and it will help build your institute’s coding culture. If you are not getting enough help from what your seniors are trying to provide, share your concerns, get things clear. This would be your key to become better than you can normally be by just studying things around. Learn from others’ experiences and grow your network.<br>

<!-- A word of caution. It's easy to get caught up doing nothing on social media. So it is better that you consciously proceed with this. However, as the world dictates, you need to have a digital social existence. Despite its threat, there are ways you can use this medium for your own benefits (more on that later). Facebook is quite popular to start with.<br>
Besides this, you need to sign up for LinkedIn (more on how to make a good linkedin profile, later).
I will write a detailed post about this topic quite soon.
Let's continue with the primer in the next post.-->
