                    <span class="foot-text2">You need to know the intrinsic property of the entire process - fear. Accept and uproot the fear of not knowing.<br>Post #7<br>Bhubaneswar, July 19 2019, 19:43 IST </span><br>

                    <p>I realized this quite late. I feel you need to know this before you face it yourself. As you shall proceed with anything new, you would, at some point of time, surely face this problem. Learning new things would make you happy and contented but at the same time you might start doubting if you really know anything about what you are working upon. Anything and everything we choose to study or try out is not shallow, its depth is far beyond our imagination. This is the most difficult thing to digest. You can't become an expert in a thing all of a sudden.<br>
                        
                        Many people you would see, say your seniors, some acquaintances who are working at tech firms, most of them are good at a specific thing. At first, while starting, the usual practice is to taste different areas and broaden your views, but over the time one has to choose a single thing or two and gain sufficient expertise in that and may be implement some projects in the same. All of a sudden you would fear the gigantic amount of things to do with so less time at hand. We need to overcome this fear and accept this very fact. The beginning time is like harvesting tea leaves. Workers don't pluck all the leaves at once, rather they pick only a few good ones among them and wait for other leaves to grow better. If you are starting, donâ€™t be scared of trying out new things. Initially, this fear that you aren't learning anything significant as compared to the totality of knowledge base can be immense. You would feel the urge to learn everything, but experiencing the inability to do it quickly is very common.<br>
                        I personally believe this condition has its pros and cons. The very realization that we don't  know things completely keeps us down to earth and vigilant towards new information and opportunities. If you know you have mistaken somewhere, stop thinking and start working. However, if you let this fear and anxiety into your life too much, it would hinder your progress. Another great source of fear is lack of information. It is worth to underline the fact that it is you who needs to keep searching for new things, stay updated with what everyone is up to, gain inspiration from them, ask for help, help others, and stay in the loop. If you know what you are doing, your fear can be easily minimized.<br>
                        So, the next time you doubt yourself while doing something, hang on and get the best out of your condition. Think from a different perspective, get suggestions from others, contemplate over what you are doing and write down your plan of action. Make sure whatever you try out is learned properly and try to implement it then and there. Find out your own ways to deal with this pressure as no one knows you better than you do.

<!-- A word of caution. It's easy to get caught up doing nothing on social media. So it is better that you consciously proceed with this. However, as the world dictates, you need to have a digital social existence. Despite its threat, there are ways you can use this medium for your own benefits (more on that later). Facebook is quite popular to start with.<br>
Besides this, you need to sign up for LinkedIn (more on how to make a good linkedin profile, later).
I will write a detailed post about this topic quite soon.
Let's continue with the primer in the next post.-->
