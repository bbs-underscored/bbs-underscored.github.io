                    <span class="foot-text2">Simple weekly roadmaps to equip you with minimum coding knowledge required to begin independent learning.<br>Bhubaneswar, March 10, 2020, 19:20 IST </span><br>

                    <p>While beginning with programming, we recommend learning C programming language first as it is quite straightforward. As a procedural language, it's often easier for beginners to grasp. It is a simpler language with fewer options and, consequently, it serves as a solid introduction to programming. However, except the "basic" track of the roadmap (which deals with syntax of the language), other portion is language agnostic. If you are not willing to code in C, we will recommend you to follow the flow of concepts covered in the documents and solve the questions in your language of choice. If you are an absolute beginner : start from the basic track and move along towards intermediate and advanced.<br>At present the attached documents were the ones I used in the winter training of newbies at IIT Bhubaneswar. Every newbie had a mentor, but having a mentor is not a necessity to complete the roadmap. More such documents will be added in near future.

<!-- A word of caution. It's easy to get caught up doing nothing on social media. So it is better that you consciously proceed with this. However, as the world dictates, you need to have a digital social existence. Despite its threat, there are ways you can use this medium for your own benefits (more on that later). Facebook is quite popular to start with.<br>
Besides this, you need to sign up for LinkedIn (more on how to make a good linkedin profile, later).
I will write a detailed post about this topic quite soon.
Let's continue with the primer in the next post.-->
