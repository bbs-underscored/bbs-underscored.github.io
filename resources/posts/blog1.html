        <p>Hola! This is Aashay Palliwar second year CSE undergrad at IIT Bhubaneswar. Let’s spare the clumsy intro and cut to the point.<br>This blog is for you if you aspire to explore the field of Computer Science and Engineering. When I started out like you folks, the huge number of options trampled my soul and successfully wasted my first semester.<br>"There is this and there’s that." <br> "Oh no! He did that."<br>"He found that." <br>"She is auditing this course."<br>"That one over there is already a master of this thing."<br>All these evil questions will eat you up if you are not aware of where you need to go and towards where you are rocketing. I want you all to save your one semester (or possibly more as was with a few people) and get into it right away in the right way.<br>All this content is my perspective. I will try to keep it as short as possible. Well, why should you care what I think? Yes, you should not. Read this to get a direction and build your own perspective. Start learning, start exploring. Get to know cool things. Share with your peers. Share with me. Teach me if I don't know. Just don't stop this flow. Remember, if you don't care about this process, it is your institute’s culture that would degrade. Your institute is dynamic. It is up to you how to develop it. It only happens through proactive sharing, feedback, and improvisations.<br>
See you around.<br>
Happy Coding!
